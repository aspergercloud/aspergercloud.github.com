To most people that I pass in the street, I might seem like a normal 19 year old male geek.  I am withdrawn, and not overly fond of talking to you unless I know you or intend to know you.  I wear mario tshirts, and funky pants from the local hippie shop when I can.  I am unshaven, and have glasses.  By some definitions, I might even be called a _hipster_ at first glance.  But if you get to know me, I'm all that and much more.

When I was first diagnosed at age 9, well, I didn't really know what happened.  To me, the biggest change was that my medication had changed from what I had been on to some new mix.  To me, that wasn't a big deal.  But to my parents, who spent the better part of five years learning all they could about Autism, the new diagnosis explained almost everything.  It explained why as a child, I would scream and cry when fireworks went off, or why I would always only eat chicken nuggets and chips when we went out.  It explained why I was fascinated with time, and why when I found something to focus on, it would hold my entire focus until I was ripped away.  To them, I believe it was like someone had handed them paper that explained me to the dot of an i and the cross of a t.  It finally was beginning to make sense.

Things began to change.  When my medication balanced out, I began to actually notice my surroundings.  To this very day, if I have my medicine later in the morning, it's like a fog is lifted off my head and everything comes into focus.  While the medication might not be the best option in the long run, my parent's believed that it would be the only option to improve my quality of life.  And I thank them for that.

With the medicine, I may still be unable to notice sarcasm or read emotions, but I am able to talk to others without melting down into a mess.  I am able to hold a license and drive, I was able to hold my first part time job for three and a half years, and so much more.  The doctor who diagnosed me, Dr Stephen Moore, still remains to be one the most important people in my life.  Even though I'm too old to be his patient now, I will never forget how he changed my life - for the better.

While Autism may not be _fun_ or it may be _annoying_ to those around you, remember that on the inside of most autistic people is an incredibly bright person, who wants to come out.  But to us, it's like the world doesn't understand us.  Again, that's from my point of view, and I am in no way intending to speak for everyone.  But for me, it's not that I misunderstand: it's the world that misunderstands me.  So if you have a child that is diagnosed with Autism, the biggest recommendation I can make is to do the research and learn to understand your special someone.  That alone is one of the greatest gifts you can give them: understanding.
