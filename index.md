tagline: Promoting Equality for all

Welcome to the Asperger Cloud Blog!  This blog is intended to promote equality for all people, and to help explain the world from the view of myself, a young adult who was diagnosed with Aspergers/Autism at the age of nine.

In this blog, I will describe the things that irritate me, bewilder me, entrall me and amaze me.  However, just because this is my point of view, it does not mean that every Asperger's person feels the same way.  Remember, we are all unique as well!

I will also talk about various foundations and projects that are helping people like myself live with our diabilities.  I do not expect that this blog will become popular, but that is ok.  As long as someone sees the messages I have, I will be happy.

This blog is not run for profit.  I do not accept donations or any kind of support.  It is merely meant to raise awareness of Autism and other mental disorders, and to help promote equality for all people regardless of mental status, gender, age or any other factor.

Here is a list of posts:

# About Me
My name is Jordan Cameron, and am currently 19 years old.  I am a first year university student studying to become a High School Teacher.  I was diagnosed at age 9 with Autism Spectrum Disorder, or more specifically, Aspergers/High functioning autism.

With the help of my incredibly supportive parents, and other beautiful people in my life, I have managed to slowly acquire the skills I need to function in the everyday world.  However, not all Autistic people are as lucky.

If you have any questions or concerns, or just want to get in touch, feel free to email me at jcameron@aspergercloud.xyz
