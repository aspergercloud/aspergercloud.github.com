<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">Lately I've started changing my life.  I've become sick of not knowing where my life is going.  I've also become sick of living in a messy space, with absolutely no organisational system or any feeling of home.  I've decided enough is enough, and it's time to change my attitude, thoughts and life. </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">About eight months ago, I was hospitalised for severe depression.  While in hospital recovering, it dawned on me that maybe owning so many things was not doing me any favours.  It seemed that I was always worried about what thing to buy next, or what thing someone else had that I didn't.  It is not healthy to be thinking about all the things you want, only to realise that you can not afford them.  That thinking is what triggered my Depression to go off.  So when I was in hospital I decided that part of my recovery would be becoming a minimalist.  This was in August of 2014. </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">Fast track to March of 2015, and I __still__ had not done anything.  I was still living in the same old messy room, with no organisation, and no sense of belonging.  To be quite honest, I was in a rut.  Then, tropical cyclone Marcia came.  I had to move all of my belongings from the all over the room to the far side, as one of my walls leaks during severe rain.  Having to spend hours cleaning and grabbing everything off of the floor was the final straw.  When the cyclone was over, I was going to fix my lifestyle.  </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">When the time came to put everything back, instead of just chucking the stuff on the floor like I would normally do, I began to slowly put things away.  Slowly but surely, I put all my stuff in it's own place.  However, my room was still severely cluttered.  I had no bench space, and every nook and cranny was jammed full of posessions that I didn't even remember I had.  I still was not happy with my room. </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">The very next Tuesday, I resorted to grabbing a stack of garbage bags, and relentlessly putting anything in them that I didn't need.  All my books, except my textbooks: gone.  All the clothes I don't wear anymore or that don't fit well: gone.  All the rubbish and broken items in my room: gone (there were four bags!).  I chucked the rubbish in the bin, and put the books and clothes in my car ready to be donated to the local St Vincet de Pauls.  Great, I had removed all clutter and unnecessary items.  But now my room was barren.  It may have been clean and minimal, but it did not feel like home.  When I showed it to a friend who was helping me, she said &quot;You can tell an Autistic person setup this room.  Everything is lined up along the walls with nothing in the center of the room.&quot; </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">So after thinking and moving things, I finally came up with a solution that was minimal, yet homely.  And I couldn't be happier.  One of my biggest obsessions that I've been fighting with for many years is my habit of spending all my money on stuff as soon as I'm paid.  Usually I spend it on things that I don't need, or want just because someone else has them.  Since starting to live like a Minimalist, I've found that the urges to spend money are few and far between, and they are not as strong as they used to be.  I have found that I am more organised, and that I am more productive in my day to day life.  I get all my chores done, and I have even found the time to start this blog. </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">But it has also helped me mentally.  It was only after starting the minimalist lifestyle that my mental health started improving.  For the many months since I was in hospital, I existed but I did not get better.  Then, when I donated most of my stuff, and threw out anything else I did not need, I found that my memory starting getting better.  I managed to finally sit down and do a budget so that I dion't just spend all my money.  I have started eating better and working out more often.  I have even started to just be content with where my life is right now, instead of thinking about where I wish it was.  Since starting a minimalist lifestyle, I feel that my life, for once, is actually working for me. </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;"> </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:50px;"><span style=" font-family:'Arial'; font-size:12pt;">However, I am not implying that minimalism is for every autistic person.  But from my experiences thus far, it is my &quot;saving grace&quot; if you will.  I am finally more organised, and happy with my life.  My suggestion is that if you  find that you, or someone you care about, is constantly obsessed with buying new things, or wanting new things, try the minimalist lifestyle.  That does not mean throw everything away, but just the unessentials.  Even if you are still unsure, just box them up, and put them out of sight.  Then, if after two months you still have stuff that is boxed up, then you can donate or throw those things out.  You never know, it may actually be the one thing that helps you organise yourself.</span></p></body></html>
